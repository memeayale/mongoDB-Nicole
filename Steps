Begin by spinning up an f1 micro with Centos 7 as the boot disk.

Open an ssh connection and sudo su to gain rootly powers

Then copy and paste all these lines at once onto the command line to add the MongoDB repository to our machine:

echo '[mongodb-org-3.2]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/$releasever/mongodb-org/3.2/x86_64/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-3.2.asc' > /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-3.2.repo

Then do a yum repolist. You should see MongoDB in your repository list
Next, install MongoDB using the command yum -y install mongodb-org
Start MongoDB by typing systemctl start mongod
Look at the status of MongoDB using this command systemctl status mongod to make sure it is running (if you see processes it is running)
Then we can log into the shell using the command mongo
Congratulations! You've just installed and logged into your first MongoDB server!

For the rest of the EC assignment we'll be using the tutorial posted here: https://docs.mongodb.com/getting-started/shell/introduction/
